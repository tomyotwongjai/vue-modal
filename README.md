### Note

-In Vue, we can add custom event by using $emit which would create custom event. Then pass what custom event we have into component which then will listen to the event and throw that event when action is given

-In Vue, we can use slot to create custom text object rather than passing the object into component which can get messy. Slot can also have default value.
